# Timestamp-Microservice
Hello there!
This is my first server side Api project for FreeCodeCamp. 

You can find it here https://timestamp-maendros.herokuapp.com/

These are the user stories i am implementing for this project 

User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
